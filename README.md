# Unvoice

Unvoice is a utility that transcribes your Voice Messages to text. Whenever you receive a Voice Message and cannot (or do not want to) listen to it, you can hand it over to Unvoice and it gets transcribed. 

Just select a Voice Message you received in a messaging app and share it with Unvoice. The Unvoice extension then handles the transcription. You can even save your transcriptions so that you have a written transcript of your Voice Messages.

And since we use the built in Speech Recognition feature of iOS, your Voice Messages are handled securely and privately. Your Voice Messages are not processed otherwise by us by any means and your transcriptions do not leave your device! 

And since the Speech Recognition supports a variety of different languages, you can even transcribe Voice Messages from your friends from all over the world.

So in a nutshell, with Unvoice you can:

- Transcribe your Voice Messages to Text Messages from a variety of different languages
- Store transcriptions, so you don't have to listen to or transcribe Voice Messages repeatedly
- Be sure that your Voice Messages are handled privately, since they get only shared with Apple and no one else
